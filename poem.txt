
In the whisper of the twilight,
When the stars begin to gleam,
Dreams awaken from their slumber,
Dancing on a silver stream.


Moonlight weaves a tender story,
Softly painting night's embrace,
Whispers of a distant glory,
In the sky's vast, endless space.


Beneath the canopy of wonder,
Hearts are drawn to mysteries,
In the hush, we pause and ponder,
Life's eternal symphonies.


So let the night unfold its magic,
In the quiet, find your peace,
For in the darkness, beauty lingers,
Bringing dreams that never cease.
